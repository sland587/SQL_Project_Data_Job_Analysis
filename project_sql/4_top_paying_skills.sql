Observations:

High-paying roles blend data with DevOps or engineering:
    Favoring skills like Terraform, Puppet, and Kafka that support automation, infrastructure, or scalable data systems.

AI/ML expertise commands premium salaries:
    With tools like DataRobot, PyTorch, and Hugging Face topping the list—showing demand for analysts who can work with 
    predictive models.

Niche or cross-functional tools boost earning power:
    Including legacy systems (SVN, Perl), communication platforms (Twilio), and workflow tools (Airflow, Notion), 
    signaling value in hybrid roles.
